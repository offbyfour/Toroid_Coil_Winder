This is the project page for an open source Toroidal Coil Winder.    

## Design Verification Testing
The design verification test list will contain all of the tests needed to confirm that the device meets all specifications and features. These tests are designed to stress the design under all operating conditions.

if you have any comments/suggestions for tests that would be good to run, feel free to create an issue.

## Production Verification Testing
The production verification test list will contain the minimum number of tests needed to confirm that the device has been assembled correctly and all parts are working. These tests are designed to ensure baseline function and will be run with minimal external equipment in order to allow the user to run the tests if necessary.

if you have any comments/suggestions for tests that would be good to run, feel free to create an issue.
